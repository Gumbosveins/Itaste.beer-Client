                <p>You can create two types or rooms, a regular tasting room and blind tasting room.</p>
                <p>The creation of the rooms are almost the same</p>
                <p>To create a regular room go into "Create room", select room name, and pin.</p>
                <p>Additionally in a blind tasting room you need to pick a reveal code, don't forget this code!</p>

                    <p>
                        Next you select how you want the beers to be reviewed.
                        You can set your desired weight on each review category. You can set taste to weigh 50% while smell only weighs 10% for example.

                <p>I recommend having the dashboard on a TV in the tasting party or in shared screen by the host if the tasting is remote</p>

                        On the left are all the beers that will be tasted. Voting on beers is locked until the host clicks a beer in the left panel to open it for review. <br />
                        The beer will automatically open in each of the tasters phones. <br />
                        When everyone has voted then the host needs to press the "Review finished" button to lock the beer for further voting.
                    </p>
                    <h3>Middle Panel</h3>

                        If the room is a blind tasting room it will look like this. <br />
                        The host can reveal the beers by pressing the eye in the right corner and type in the reveal code.

                        You can add a comment to your vote and in blind tasting you can guess what beer you are tasting.

                        This page is made by one man, me Gumbo and I'm obviously not a front end developer :P <br />
                        I made this page because I hate in every beer tasting you need to wait for at least an hour while the host adds all the results to excel to get the results. <br />
